# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Days 16 - 68: September 16 - November 7, 2019 - DRAFT*

****Background**:  I'm not the best example to follow when it comes to taking the #100DaysOfCode challenge - you can read more about that in my [README.md](https://github.com/webdevholland/100-days-of-code/blob/master/README.md#ive-joined-the-100daysofcode-challenge---sep-1-2019).*

**Overall Update**:  Mainly *listened* to videos from Brad Schiff's JavaScript course in the Udemy app while driving to & from work.  Supplemented JS learning using Grasshopper coding app a few times.  Another coding app, Career Karma, has proven to be great resource.  Planning on enrolling in Nucamp coding bootcamp in 2020.  Transitioned from being financial analyst to data analyst in late October.  See Links for this log entry.

**Highlights & Low Points**:
* In Schiff's JS course, finished sections on "Server Basics" & "Database Basics".
* Also went through ~80-85% of section on "Starting Our Complex App (App #2)" in JS course.
* Listened to JS course videos a couple of times or more.  Concepts were harder to grasp, at times, when learning by audio only.
* Created CodePen on anonymous & arrow functions to go along w/ JS course vid on those topics.
* Spent more time *listening* to JS course videos.  Very little time spent doing hands-on coding practice.  Haven't reviewed course's example CodePens yet.
* Grasshopper coding app great for on-the-go practice in JS, but ended up removing app from phone.  Wasn't using app often.
* 
* Thrilled to learn about Nucamp coding bootcamp from member within Career Karma coding app.
* Looking forward to taking Web Development Fundamentals course with Nucamp, hopefully around late winter/early spring 2020.
* want to look more into data visualization as well as continue building on front-end web dev skills.
* this week:  registered for in-person course on creating better visuals such as in slides (got waitlisted on course for data viz in tableau).
* Excited about taking Nucamp course "Web Development Fundamentals" in the new year.
* July 2020:  registered for data course at work

**Thoughts & Tactics:**
* .
* (see Links for the day).
* set aside savings in case i decide to take longer nucamp course "front-end web + mobile development".
* .
* goal-setting w/ CK coding group "Women that code".
* try to make greater use of lunch hours at work as well as time after dinner to create more code pens to go along w/ js course.

### Days 9 - 15: September 16, 2019 (worked overnight into AM)*

***Background**:  2:16 am.  Stretched out on couch in living room with laptop.  Lofi hip-hop from ChilledCow softly playing (see Links for the day).  Dozed off in middle of working on this.  Forced myself to wrap up already around 5:30 am.

***I know I haven't been following the rules of this challenge to a T.  I don't want to get bogged down by rules so I'm modifying them to better suit my lifestyle.  I think it's more important that I consistently learn every day even if I don't get a chance to update this log.md or Tweet my progress (I have been handwriting notes in a little journal in the meantime).  I'll talk more about this later in the README.md as well as in the Rules and FAQ sections of this repo.***

**Today's Summary Progress**:  Reviewed video "Scope & Context (Part 2)" from Brad Schiff's JavaScript course.  Created CodePen #11 to show how '.call' method is used as part of lesson on context.  Already watched next video "Miscellaneous Info (Part 1)" so moved on to next six videos, but didn't cover any of them in this log entry.  See Links for the day.

**Quick Notes**:
* '.call' method is attached to a function to allow 'this' keyword to point to an object which will use the function.
* To see how '.call' method works, go to CodePen #11 in Links for the day.
* In Section 2 of JS course, "The 10 Days of JavaScript: The Language Itself", watched final three section videos after "Miscellaneous Info (Part 1)" :  "Miscellaneous Info (Part 2)"; "Building To-Do App (Part 1)"; and "Building To-Do App (Part 2)".
* Misc info vids covered topics like anonymous functions, arrow functions and function hoisting.
* In Section 3 of JS course, "Server Basics", watched first three section videos:  "Why Do We Need a Server?"; "Node.js Intro"; and "Text Editor Software".

**Thoughts & Tactics:**
* Time-consuming process to try to recreate code examples in CodePen (with comments!), update this log.md and finally Tweet about my progress.
* Maybe too much time spent documenting?  But isn't documentation part of programmer's job?  In blog article by Andy Lester called "10 Things You Should Have Learned With Your Software Engineering Degree—or at Coding Boot Camp—but Probably Didn’t", item #6 was "Clear and effective written communication" (see Links for the day).
* Since JS course videos can be played from phone, started listening to videos while driving to/from work; listened straight through without pausing.
* Also played videos at other times like during lunch break, before going to sleep or after getting up in the morning.
* Would play same video at least twice on same day.  Repetition helpful since might not be pausing video to take notes or might be missing out on visuals.

### Days 7 & 8: September 8, 2019*

***Background**:  Meant to do Day 7 last night, but didn't which was why it got combined with Day 8 today.  Spent ~2 hours learning to code as well as documenting instead of just 1.

***I know I haven't been following the rules of this challenge to a T.  I don't want to get bogged down by rules so I'm modifying them a bit to better suit my lifestyle.  I think it's more important that I consistently learn & build every day regardless of what day or time it is.  I'll talk about this later in the README.md as well as in the Rules and FAQ sections of this repo.***

**Today's Summary Progress**:  Watched "Scope & Context (Part 2)" video in Brad Schiff's JavaScript course (see Links for the day).  Context covered in Part 2 video (scope was in Part 1 video).  Created CodePen #10 (see Links for the day).  Tomorrow, will continue working on this Pen or create another Pen to further demonstrate concept of context.  Also watched next video "Miscellaneous Info (Part 1)" after "Scope & Context (Part 2)" video but today's log entry only about context.

**Quick Notes**:
* Context has to do with objects.
* As with scope, confusion over context can lead to problems with code.
* Even though may be too early at this stage to learn about scope & context, still good to keep these in mind as you're debugging your code.
* Keyword 'this' is introduced --> is flexible esp. when used with '.call' method (to be covered in next log entry).
* 'this' points to object executing function.

**Thoughts & Tactics:**
* Tried something new:  watched video straight through without pausing while taking *handwritten* notes.  Then, later on, transferred notes to this repo's log.md.  Replayed relevant parts of video to fill in any gaps in log.md as well as recreate video's code in CodePen.  Think I like this new way better instead of watching video for first time while updating log.md and working on Pen.
* Feels like my writing is improving (particularly editing skills) which will come in handy later once ready to start blogging.  Hmmm, maybe once #100DaysOfFitness done (see Links for the day), can move on to #100DaysOfBlogging?

### Day 6: September 7, 2019*

***Background**:  Went to bed last night as opposed to falling asleep on the couch & getting up in the wee hours of the morning.  So, instead of working on this overnight like I have been doing every day since I started #100DaysOfCode, I'm working on this now at a time when most start their day.  If I can come back to work on another round of this challenge later tonight, I'm counting it as Day 7.

***I know I'm not following the rules of this challenge to a T.  I don't want to get bogged down by rules so I'm modifying them a bit to better suit my lifestyle.  I think it's more important that I consistently learn & build every day regardless of what day or time it is.  I'll talk about this later in the README.md as well as in the Rules and FAQ sections of this repo.***

**Today's Summary Progress**:  Continued from yesterday & finished "Scope & Context (Part 1)" in Brad Schiff's JavaScript course (see Links for the day).  Wrapped up on Scope concepts.  (Part 2 of lesson will be on Context.)

**Quick Notes**:  
* Possible to modify or mutate variable in global scope from within local scope.
* "Scope moves in one direction.  It is a one-way street." (starting from within the inside and then going out.)
* Declare variable = create variable.
* 'let' didn't exist until about 3 or 4 years ago.  If looking at someone else's older code, may see 'var' instead of 'let'.
* 'let' uses block scope... code looks for nearest enclosing block as defined by curly brackets '{ }'.
* 'var' uses function scope... only cares about curly brackets '{ }' of a function.
* Block scope is what most developers use & are familiar with esp. in other programming languages.  Block scope leads to less problems & confusion.
* Recommended to never use 'var'.
* If code isn't working, might want to check your scope & make sure variables are pointing towards what you think they should be pointing towards.  Can always use console.log to check value/result.
* Refer to CodePen #9 (see Links for the day).

**Thoughts & Tactics:**
* Helped to pause & rewind video as often as I needed not only to work on CodePen #9, but to take notes too!
* Connected with & understood material better when I took notes (was probably the case as well when I was in college ages ago).

### Day 5: September 5-6, 2019 (worked overnight into AM)*

***Background**:  Never went to bed!  Dozed off on couch, got up around 3 am & started working on computer (first spent time documenting my other challenge, [#100DaysOfFitness](http://bit.ly/100DaysOfFitnessFullLog).

**Today's Summary Progress**:  Moved on to next video in Brad Schiff's JavaScript course (see Links for the day).  "Scope & Context (Part 1)".

**Quick Notes**:
* Scope --> variables.  Context --> objects.
* Global vs local scope --> when code is executed, variables are read from the inside out, going up one level at a time.
* Same label name can be used for variables at different levels of scope.
* Refer to CodePen #8 (see Links for the day).

**Thoughts & Tactics:**
* Feel like things are starting to make more sense to me (i.e. global vs local scope).  Various levels of scope makes me think of a staircase.
* TGIF!!!  Starting tomorrow, hope to get back to a better schedule where I'm actually recording what I do ON THE SAME DAY I begin an activity!

### Day 4: September 4-5, 2019 (worked overnight into AM)

**Today's Summary Progress**: Continued watching video in Brad Schiff's JavaScript course (see Links for the day).  Same topic- returning vs mutating.

**Quick Notes**:  
* Picked right back up with two array methods that are extremely valuable even though all they do is return values, not mutate array:  array.map() & array.filter().
* Forked yesterday's Pen to create CodePen #7 (see Links for the day).
* '.map()' is higher-order function:  it accepts another function as an argument.  '.map()' function returns a brand new array.
* '.filter()' is another higher-order function that also returns a brand new array.
* '.map()' & '.filter()' can become incredibly powerful because they can be chained together as in this example:  let babyDogNames = pets.filter(onlyDogs).filter(onlyBabies).map(nameOnly).
* More examples to come of chaining of data types; this isn't limited to arrays only.

**Thoughts & Tactics:**
* Bookmark feature available with video is very helpful... knew exactly where to pick right up from yesterday.
* Found myself replaying video at certain points because I nodded off... not because material is boring, but because it's 4 am... again...
* Caught in vicious cycle of working overnight... hope to break free of this pattern this coming weekend (just two more days!)

### Day 3: September 3-4, 2019 (worked overnight into AM)

**Today's Summary Progress**: Started to watch next video in Brad Schiff's JavaScript course (see Links for the day).  Difference between returning & mutating covered.  Didn't finish watching video; will continue in Day 4.

**Quick Notes**:  
* Recall from previous lesson '.push' method to add to an array. This changes or mutates array.
* In Pen #6 (see Links for the day), '.push' not only mutated array, but also returned number of items/objects in array (in this case, four animals in 'pets' array).
* Recall '.map' & '.filter' methods first mentioned in last video watched. These two methods extremely useful even though they only return number of items in array, not mutate array.

**Thoughts & Tactics:**
* Will include pic of Pen #6 when I tweet today's progress at [@webdevholland](https://twitter.com/webdevholland).
* Will also tweet link to Collection of pens I've created so far.
* Soooooo glad I'll be working my day job from home (starts in several hours).
* Gotta go to sleep!!!

### Day 2: September 2-3, 2019 (worked overnight into AM)

**Today's Summary Progress**: Watched next three videos in Brad Schiff's JavaScript course (see Links for the day). Arrays, making decisions and higher-order functions covered.

**Quick Notes**:  
* Array = collection (see Links for the day). Square brackets used to hold array of items '[ ]'. Add to an array with '.push'. Remove from array with '.splice'. These are examples of methods (method = ability).
* 'If' / 'else' statement introduced. 'If' statement can stand on its own without 'else' block.
* Higher-order function, part I: function accepting another function as an argument. To see example, scroll down to Day 1 of this Log and within Links, click next to CodePen #2 or "Object example" hyperlink.  See line 1 in JS editor of Object example Pen which shows function called 'ChristinesFunction' passed as argument. Higher-order function, part II: function returning another function as a result (see CodePen #5 under Links for Day 2) '.forEach' method introduced & demonstrated with example using array. '.map' and '.filter' other methods mentioned.

**Thoughts:**
* Heard of array before, also thought of it as list of items.
* Brad acknowledges that lessons not too exciting so far. Like he's saying, "I know this has been tough to go through, but hang in there". Foundation being laid for more exciting things to come- like building own application! Looking forward to progressing through rest of course :-)
* I hope I can function today (no pun intended), haven't gotten much sleep ZZZzzzz

### Day 1: September 1-2, 2019 (worked overnight into AM)

**Today's Summary Progress**: Started Brad Schiff's JavaScript course on Udemy (see Links for the day).  Watched videos on course preview, introductory lesson, functions and objects.

**Quick Notes**:  
* Course preview differentiates language (syntax) from environment (web browser, Node.js, MongoDB).  Need to learn syntax first before worrying about environments language is used in.
* Played with JavaScript in console of Chrome (see Links for the day).  Keywords *let* and *variable* introduced.
* Created functions (see Links for the day):  came up with own names for functions (arguments) and defined functions with "recipe".
* Think of object (see Links for the day) as container which stores properties inside curly brackets '{ }'.  Can look inside object with a dot '.'. For example in cat.name, cat is the object and name is the property stored inside.

**Thoughts:**
* Heard of Node.js, but no prior knowledge of or experience with it.  Took MongoDB course a while ago when Code School used to exist (it's now Pluralsight).
* First time playing around with JS in console; previously only tinkered with HTML & CSS in Developer tools.  Recall *let* and *variable* from Grasshopper app.
* Happy to be using CodePen.  Later on, would love to experiment with others' Pens or have fun with CodePen Challenges.
