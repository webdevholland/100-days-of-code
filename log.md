# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 1, 2019 - PRELIMINARY ENTRY

**Today's Summary Progress**: Started Brad Schiff's JavaScript course on Udemy (see below Links).  Watched videos on course preview, introductory lesson,...

**Notes**:  
* Course preview distinguishes language (syntax) versus environment (web browser, Node.js, MongoDB).  Need to learn syntax first before worrying about environments language is used in.
* Played with JavaScript in console of Chrome (see below Links).  Keywords *let* and *variable* mentioned.

**Thoughts:**
* Heard of Node.js, but no prior knowledge or experience with it.  Took MongoDB course a while ago when Code School used to exist (it's now Pluralsight).
* First time playing around with JS in console; previously only tinkered with HTML & CSS in Developer tools.  Recall *let* and *variable* from [Grasshopper](https://grasshopper.codes/) app.
* Happy to be using CodePen.  Maybe later on I can create Pen using API like [this Studio Ghibli one](https://codepen.io/aimeetacchi/full/eqbxvm).

    ##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
