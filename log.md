# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: September 2, 2019 - PRELIMINARY ENTRY

**Today's Summary Progress**: Watching next three videos in Brad Schiff's JavaScript course (see Links for the day). Arrays, making decisions and higher-order functions covered.

**Quick Notes**:  
* Array = collection. Square brackets used to hold array of items '[ ]'. Add to an array with '.push'. Remove from array with '.splice'. These are examples of methods (method = ability).
*
*

**Thoughts:**
* Heard of array before, also thought of it as list of items.

### Day 1: September 1, 2019

**Today's Summary Progress**: Started Brad Schiff's JavaScript course on Udemy (see Links for the day).  Watched videos on course preview, introductory lesson, functions and objects.

**Quick Notes**:  
* Course preview differentiates language (syntax) from environment (web browser, Node.js, MongoDB).  Need to learn syntax first before worrying about environments language is used in.
* Played with JavaScript in console of Chrome (see Links for the day).  Keywords *let* and *variable* introduced.
* Created functions (see Links for the day):  came up with own names for functions (arguments) and defined functions with "recipe".
* Think of object (see Links for the day) as container which stores properties inside curly brackets '{ }'.  Can look inside object with a dot '.'. For example in cat.name, cat is the object and name is the property stored inside.

**Thoughts:**
* Heard of Node.js, but no prior knowledge of or experience with it.  Took MongoDB course a while ago when Code School used to exist (it's now Pluralsight).
* First time playing around with JS in console; previously only tinkered with HTML & CSS in Developer tools.  Recall *let* and *variable* from Grasshopper app.
* Happy to be using CodePen.  Later on, would love to experiment with others' Pens or have fun with CodePen Challenges.

    ##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
