### Day 2: September 2-3, 2019 (worked overnight into AM)

**Today's Summary Progress**: Watched next three videos in Brad Schiff's JavaScript course (see Links for the day). Arrays, making decisions and higher-order functions covered.

**Quick Notes**:  
* Array = collection (see Links for the day). Square brackets used to hold array of items '[ ]'. Add to an array with '.push'. Remove from array with '.splice'. These are examples of methods (method = ability).
* 'If' / 'else' statement introduced. 'If' statement can stand on its own without 'else' block.
* Higher-order function, part I: function accepting another function as an argument. To see example, scroll down to Day 1 of this Log and within Links, click next to CodePen #2 or "Object example" hyperlink.  See line 1 in JS editor of Object example Pen which shows function called 'ChristinesFunction' passed as argument. Higher-order function, part II: function returning another function as a result (see CodePen #5 under Links for Day 2) '.forEach' method introduced & demonstrated with example using array. '.map' and '.filter' other methods mentioned.

**Thoughts:**
* Heard of array before, also thought of it as list of items.
* Brad acknowledges that lessons not too exciting so far. Like he's saying, "I know this has been tough to go through, but hang in there". Foundation being laid for more exciting things to come- like building own application! Looking forward to progressing through rest of course :-)
* I hope I can function today (no pun intended), haven't gotten much sleep ZZZzzzz

### Day 1: September 1-2, 2019 (worked overnight into AM)

**Today's Summary Progress**: Started Brad Schiff's JavaScript course on Udemy (see Links for the day).  Watched videos on course preview, introductory lesson, functions and objects.

**Quick Notes**:  
* Course preview differentiates language (syntax) from environment (web browser, Node.js, MongoDB).  Need to learn syntax first before worrying about environments language is used in.
* Played with JavaScript in console of Chrome (see Links for the day).  Keywords *let* and *variable* introduced.
* Created functions (see Links for the day):  came up with own names for functions (arguments) and defined functions with "recipe".
* Think of object (see Links for the day) as container which stores properties inside curly brackets '{ }'.  Can look inside object with a dot '.'. For example in cat.name, cat is the object and name is the property stored inside.

**Thoughts:**
* Heard of Node.js, but no prior knowledge of or experience with it.  Took MongoDB course a while ago when Code School used to exist (it's now Pluralsight).
* First time playing around with JS in console; previously only tinkered with HTML & CSS in Developer tools.  Recall *let* and *variable* from Grasshopper app.
* Happy to be using CodePen.  Later on, would love to experiment with others' Pens or have fun with CodePen Challenges.
